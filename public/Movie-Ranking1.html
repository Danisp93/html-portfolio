<h1>The Best Movies According to Dani</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>This is my favourite film about Rome Empire. One of the best I have ever seen.</p>

<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>With this film I get a mix of emotions. It takes me back to my chilhood and now I watch it with my kids every year for Christmas as a tradition.</p>

<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>This film I remember it as the first film I have ever watched. And I have watched it about 100 times and, for sure, I will watch 100 times more.</p>
